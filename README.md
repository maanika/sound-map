The project is entitled “Sound Navigation and Obstacle Detection to Aid the Visually Impaired”, and the name given to the system that achieves this is “SoundMap”. SoundMap is a Real Time Embedded System that helps guide the vision impaired to pre-defined destinations, using the human ear’s ability to localize sound. It achieves this by generating sound, which can be perceived originating from the destination. SoundMap also consists of direct speech output, to provide the user information regarding the selectable destinations, signal conditions, and the battery level. In addition, it has the capability of Obstacle Detection, when connected to a belt, that has ultrasonic sensors, and vibrating motors attached to it.
